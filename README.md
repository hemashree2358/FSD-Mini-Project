# FSD-Mini-Project
Creating a lab manual generator in Django involves setting up the project and app, defining models for users, lab manuals, and sections. Views handle creating, editing, viewing, and deleting manuals and sections, while templates provide the UI. URLs map views to endpoints, and forms manage user input. User authentication secures access.
